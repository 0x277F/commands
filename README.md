# Aikar Commands
## WARNING!!! PRE-ALPHA
This is a rough import of my command framework to be a standalone Library. This project is currently extremely volatile and will receive drastic changes.

We haven't even decided a name yet!

## Purpose
This is the Framework used on [Empire Minecraft](https://ref.emc.gs/Aikar?gac=commands.github).

Many people have wanted to use this framework for themselves, so I am trying to make it general purpose (with help from the community) so that others can use it just as simple as they can [TaskChain](https://taskchain.emc.gs) now.

## Contributing
See Issues section. Lots to decide and frame out. 

Join [#aikar on Spigot IRC - irc.spi.gt](https://aikarchat.emc.gs) to discuss. 

Or [Code With Aikar](https://aikardiscord.emc.gs) Discord.
