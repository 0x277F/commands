# Aikar Command Framework (ACF)
## Purpose
This is the Framework used on [Empire Minecraft](https://ref.emc.gs/Aikar?gac=commands.github).

Many people have wanted to use this framework for themselves, so I am trying to make it general purpose (with help from the community) so that others can use it just as simple as they can [TaskChain](https://taskchain.emc.gs) now.

## Beta Testing
I believe the framework may be usable at this stage. Beta testers welcome

See [Using ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki/Using-ACF) on how to add ACF to your plugin and using it.

THE API MAY BREAK! We are on:
 - GROUP: co.aikar.commands
 - ARTIFACTID: acf
 - VERSION `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`

## Targeted Platforms
Requires CraftBukkit, Spigot or Paper.

We have no intentions to support other Servers. If you want on Sponge or something else, you will need to fork and add support for it.

## Example
```java
@CommandAlias("res|residence|resadmin")
public class ResidenceCommand extends BaseCommand {
    
    @Subcommand("pset")
    @CommandCompletion("@allplayers:30 @flags @flagstates")
    public void onResFlagPSet(Player player, @Flags("admin") Residence res, EmpireUser[] users, String flag, @Values("@flagstates") String state) {
        res.getPermissions().setPlayerFlag(player, Stream.of(users).map(EmpireUser::getName).collect(Collectors.joining(",")), flag, state, resadmin, true);
    }

    
    @Subcommand("area replace")
    @CommandPermission("residence.admin")
    public void onResAreaReplace(Player player, CuboidSelection selection, @Flags("verbose") Residence res, @Default("main") @Single String area) {
        res.replaceArea(player,
            new CuboidArea(selection),
            area,
            resadmin);
    }
    
}
@CommandAlias("gr")
public class GroupCommand extends BaseCommand {
    public GroupCommand() {
        super("group");
    }
    @Subcommand("invitenear|invnear")
    @CommandAlias("invitenear|invnear|ginvnear")
    @Syntax("[radius=32] &e- Invite Nearby Players to the group.")
    public void onInviteNear(Player player, @Default("32") Integer radius) {
        int maxRadius = UserUtil.isModerator(player) ? 256 : 64;
        radius = !UserUtil.isSrStaff(player) ? Math.min(maxRadius, radius) : radius;
        List<String> names = player.getNearbyEntities(radius, Math.min(128, radius), radius)
            .stream().filter((e) -> e instanceof Player && !UserUtil.isVanished((Player) e))
            .map(CommandSender::getName)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        Groups.invitePlayers(player, names);
    }

    @Subcommand("invite|inv")
    @CommandAlias("invite|inv|ginv")
    @Syntax("<name> [name2] [name3] &e- Invite Players to the group.")
    public void onInvite(Player player, String[] names) {
        Groups.invitePlayers(player, names);
    }

    @Subcommand("kick|gkick")
    @CommandAlias("gkick")
    @Syntax("<player> &e- Kick Player from the group.")
    public void onKick(Player player, @Flags("leader") Group group, OnlinePlayer toKick) {
        group.kickPlayer(player, toKick.getPlayer());
    }

}
```
## Why does it require Java 8+?
Get off your dinosaur and get on this rocket ship!

Dinosaurs have been dead for a long time, so get off it before you start to smell.
